# PASS Summit 2018
Repository for the PASS Summit data visualization talk. The final version of the pbix file can be found in the PASS_Summit_2018/PBIX folder. The Jupyter Notebook used in the session can be found in the root of this repository. The data set used in the Jupyter Notebook can be found in the PASS_Summit_2018/Data folder.

I attempted to be verbose in my explanations in the jupyter notebook. If you have questions please reach me at questions@dieselanalytics.com and I will answer them as quickly as I am able to.

Some of the visualization features that works in the Power BI Desktop do not work in the Power BI service. I am in communication with the Microsoft team to see how and when those issue will be resolved. I will update this README when I get more information. 

The version of R that is used in the service lags behind the current version of R. At the time of this post, the version of R that is being used in the Power BI Service is R 3.4.2 which was released on 2017.09.28. Your R visual development should be done using the same R environment that the service is using. You can get previous versions of R from CRAN. You can have multiple versions of R installed on the same machine but you may run into problems in Power BI. To avoid those problems I recommend that you just have the version of R that the Power BI service is using on your machine.
