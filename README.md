# PASS Summit 2018
Repository for the PASS Summit data visualization talk. The final version of the pbix file can be found in the PASS_Summit_2018/PBIX folder. The Jupyter Notebook used in the session can be found in the root of this repository. The data set used in the Jupyter Notebook can be found in the PASS_Summit_2018/Data folder.

I attempted to be verbose in my explanations in the jupyter notebook. If you have questions please reach me at questions@dieselanalytics.com and I will answer them as quickly as I am able to.

Some of the features in the jupyter notebook do not work in the Power BI service. I am in communication with the Microsoft team to see how and when that issue will be resolved. I will update this README when I get more information.
